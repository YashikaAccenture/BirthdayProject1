        <div class="holder">I need to display user entered text into a fixed size div. 
		What i want is for the font size to be automatically adjusted so that the text 
		fills the box as much as possible.
I'd probably want to start with a maximum font size and while the text is 
too big to fit the container, shrink the font size until it fits and the 
font must be displayed as a single line. Is it possible to do this using only css and html.
